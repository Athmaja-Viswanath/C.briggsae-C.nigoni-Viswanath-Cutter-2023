### This Repository provides all the necessary codes and data to replicate analyses, results and figures presented in Viswanath & Cutter (2023). 

## 1-Input
### Contains text files with readcounts 
### 1. Cbr_fc_counts_AJ.txt - contains reads obtained by aligning all samples (_C. briggsae_, _C. nigoni_, HIL1 & HIL2) to _C. briggsae_ genome
### 2. Cni_fc_counts_AJ.txt - contains reads obtained by aligning all samples (_C. briggsae_, _C. nigoni_, HIL1 & HIL2) to _C. nigoni_ genome
### 3. orthologs_dnds2_athmaja_wb.txt - contains 1:1 orthologous genes between _C. briggsae_ and _C. nigoni_
